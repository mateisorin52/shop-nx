‚ú® **This workspace has been generated by [Nx, a Smart, fast and extensible build system.](https://nx.dev)** ‚ú®

**üé¨Initial setup**

- The app uses node v16.14.0 and npm v8.3.1
- ‚ú®While in frontend run "npm install"‚ú®
- You also need to setup and start the express server

## Start the app 

‚ú®To start the development server run:‚ú®
- 'npx nx serve' (or only 'nx serve' if you have globally installed nx)

##  Testing


Nx workspace offers E2E testing as a separate app. However, in this case i've tried a different approach since this specific workspace is not really a suite of apps but only one app (frontend) so I ended up creating a different app for testing (cypress directory) using the same config without using the actual nx.json file (not the best approach)

‚ú®To run te E2E tests run:‚ú®
- npx cypress run (This will run the tests (1 test) in the background without opening the browser instance)
- npx cypress open (This will open the GUI for the cypress app so that you can visualize the way tests are ran - kind of like a debug)

‚ú®To run te unit tests run:‚ú®
- nx test

I've also added basic search filter on the /articles endpoint and universal filter on frontend(you can pass whatever key-value pair and it will be sent as a query param using react-query)
