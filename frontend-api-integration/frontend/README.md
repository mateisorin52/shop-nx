✨ **This workspace has been generated by [Nx, a Smart, fast and extensible build system.](https://nx.dev)** ✨

**🎬Initial setup**

- The app uses node v16.14.0 and npm v8.3.1
- ✨While in frontend run "npm install"✨
- You also need to setup and start the express server

## Start the app 

✨To start the development server run:✨
- 'npx nx serve' (or only 'nx serve' if you have nx globally installed)

##  Testing


Nx workspace offers E2E testing as a separate app. However, in this case i've tried a different approach since this specific workspace is not really a suite of apps but only one app (frontend) so I ended up creating a different app for testing (cypress directory) using the same config without using the actual nx.json file (not the best approach)

✨To run te E2E tests run:✨
- npx cypress run (This will run the tests (1 test) in the background without opening the browser instance)
- npx cypress open (This will open the GUI for the cypress app so that you can visualize the way tests are ran - kind of like a debug)

✨To run the unit tests run:✨
- nx test

I've also added basic search filter on the /articles endpoint and universal filter on frontend(you can pass whatever key-value pair and it will be sent as a query param using react-query)


## Docker

I've also dockerized the app although I'm really a fan of containerization of frontends or at least in development.
In simple words, the app is built inside a container and the build is served by nginx from port 80(container) to port 80 (outside machine)

- 🫙You need to have docker installed🫙

✨To run the app run :✨
- docker build -t frontend
- docker run -p 80:80 frontend
- the app should run on localhost now
